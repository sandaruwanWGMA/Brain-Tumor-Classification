# Brain-Tumor-Classification

This project showcases the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor image classification into four distinct categories, along with an additional category for images devoid of tumors. Using a dataset of brain scan images, our objective is to construct a robust model capable of accurately categorizing these scans. Explore this repository to gain insights into the CNN architecture and its application in medical image analysis, paving the way for improved brain tumor diagnosis and research.
